### Open browser tabs when participants sit down for first time

Steps:

1. The user sits down to a workstation with a browser pre-opened with [this repo's docs](https://brianzelip.github.io/modern-web-workshop) as the only tab.

2. People create a github account

  1. check email to verify github email if creating a new GH account

  2. check email to verify device used to log in to GH

Once everyone has a GH account and has verified the device they're working on:

1. Fork this repo

2. Fork back end repo

3. Fork front end repo
