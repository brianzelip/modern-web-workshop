### 12.1. Checkout branch 4

Let's "checkout" the next stage of our back end application to get and serve data from [https://swapi.co](https://swapi.co) instead of serving data directly from our back end.

Copy and paste the following commands in the Glitch console:

1. Checkout branch 4<br><br><code>git checkout 4</code><br><br>
2. Refresh the Glitch file system to see branch 4<br><br><code>refresh</code><br><br>

### 12.2. Follow along with the instructor

Let's get and serve data from swapi.co!

1. Edit routes.js
2. Edit controllers.js
3. Test the new API endpoint in the browser using different resource parameters
