# Workshop needs

This document collects the ideal tech stack checklist for the Towson computer lab, and performance flow for use of ideal online resources to build the workshop around.

~or~

This document collects the assumptions about the Towson computer lab tech stack, and the performance flow of GitHub, CodeSandbox, Netlify, and Glitch.

## Computer lab

- Need to check that the online resources I want to hit, can handle 30 different requests from a the same IP range at the same time
- what happens when an attendee falls way behind?
- what happens if a github account creation doesn't work?
    - sign up for each online resource individually - this promotes the notion of minimizing the use of online platforms

## Online resources

1. GitHub
2. CodeSandox
3. Netlify
4. Glitch

## Docs to look up and have on hand

1. Express
2. Vue
3. MDN
4. Node, or npm
