# Workshop needs

This document collects the ideal tech stack checklist for the Towson computer lab, and performance flow for use of ideal online resources to build the workshop around.

~or~

This document collects the assumptions about the Towson computer lab tech stack, and the performance flow of GitHub, CodeSandbox, Netlify, and Glitch.

## Computer lab

- Need to check that the online resources I want to hit, can handle 30 different requests from a the same IP range at the same time
- what happens when an attendee falls way behind?
- what happens if a github account creation doesn't work?
  - sign up for each online resource individually - this promotes the notion of minimizing the use of online platforms

## Online resources

1. GitHub
2. CodeSandox
3. Netlify
4. Glitch

## Docs to look up and have on hand

1. Express
2. Vue
3. MDN
4. Node, or npm

## Glitch console instructions

Need to have commands at the ready for copy/pasting into the glitch console to get the GH branches working.

See here: https://support.glitch.com/t/way-to-import-code-from-specific-branch-of-repo/2027/6?u=brianzelip

Start with a new 'hello-webpage' glitch project.

```bash
# 1. move to the home directory
cd /

# 2. remove all visible files in the app directory
rm -rf /app/*

# 3. remove all hidden files in the app directory
rm -rf /app/.*

# 4. clone your back end repository
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/modern-web-back-end.git app

# 5. move into the app directory
cd app

# 6. refresh the glitch web editor
refresh
```

Note: always end with `refresh` when switching branches in order to see the new files in the glitch user interface
